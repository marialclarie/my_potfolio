    <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
    <h2>My Educational background</h2>
    <p>High school: St. Marks Girls School</p>
    <p>College: KIMS College - I pursued a Diploma Program in Business Management</p>
    <p>University: Kenya Methodist University - I pursued a Bachelor of Business Administration Majoring in Procurement & Supply Management</p>
    <h3>Why programming?</h3>
    <p>My interest in programming started very recently. I have worked in customer care for a long time, and I believe that technology can be leveraged in improving customer services.

      I do not have solid background working with computers but I have the passion and what it takes to learn this new skill.
